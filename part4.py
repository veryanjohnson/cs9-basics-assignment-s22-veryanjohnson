Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integer inputs. Those two number will be the base and height of a triangle. 
The program will then output the area of that triangle. (Reminder: the area of a triangle can be calculated by (base * height)/2 ).

What should appear on the console when this code runs:

Enter the base: 8
Enter the height: 3
The area of the triangle is 12.0

#start writing your code below

integer1 = int(input("Enter the base: "))
integer2 = int(input("Enter the height: "))

print("The area of the triangle is", (integer1 * integer2)/2)
